1) `architecture.md` — High-level architecture and goals.
2) `event_model.md` — The event schema and handler contract.
3) `api.md` — Public API sketch and expected behavior.
4) `implementation_plan.md` — Phased implementation checklist.
5) `integration_notes.md` — How to integrate with arg_digest, dep_digest, and MolSysMT.

## Scope
These documents define the initial plan and interfaces. They are not a finalized specification and may evolve as implementation starts.
