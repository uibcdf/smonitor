# Library End Users

This route is for people using a library `A` that already integrates SMonitor.

You do not need to learn SMonitor internals to benefit from it.

## What this route helps with

- understanding warnings and errors shown by `A`,
- selecting useful diagnostics profile/verbosity in scripts and notebooks,
- preparing high-quality bug reports for maintainers.

## Recommended sequence

1. [Reading Messages in Library A](reading-messages.md)
2. [Choosing Profiles and Verbosity](profiles-and-verbosity.md)
3. [Using Bundles for Support](using-bundles-for-support.md)
4. [Reporting Reproducible Issues](reporting-reproducible-issues.md)
