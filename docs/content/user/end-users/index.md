# Library End Users

This route is for people using a library `A` that already integrates SMonitor.

You do not need to learn SMonitor internals to benefit from it.

If you just want to keep working with library `A`, that is fine: you can use
`A` normally and treat SMonitor messages as helpful guidance when they appear.

## What this route helps with

- understanding warnings and errors shown by `A`,
- selecting useful diagnostics profile/verbosity in scripts and notebooks,
- preparing high-quality bug reports for maintainers.
